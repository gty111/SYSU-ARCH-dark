# Before the LAB

**There is some points you need to mind**

- **IMPORTANT:YOU NEED TO COMPLETE THIS LAB WITH GEM5 OF VERSION 22.0.0.2**

- GEM5 provides two ways of simulation (SE/FS). In this LAB, we only need to use **SE** mode.

- Label `challenge` means this part of content is a little difficult, you can skip it or do your best to solve it

- In your report, you should give proper introduction about your work including answering the questions or completing the challenge part and so on.
